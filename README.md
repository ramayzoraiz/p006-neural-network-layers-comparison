<br>
Testing folder contains plain python neural network to verify some results.
<br>
Datasets used are moons, flowers, circles and two_spirals. Folders are named after these and contain 2 tensorflow and 2 pytorch implementation ipynb files. 2 files of framework achieve same results but different style of APIs.
